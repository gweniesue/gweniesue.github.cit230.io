                    Billings, Montana's largest city, is a metropolitan hub and commercial and cultural center 
                    for a large part of eastern Montana and northern Wyoming. That made it a natural choice for 
                    a temple to serve the members of those areas who were filled with faith as the Church grew 
                    stronger in the city. Ordinance workers, Maurice and Maude Asay, said at the temple's dedication, 
                    "We have believed for the last 25 years that we would have a temple here."
                    <br><br>
                    On the exterior, the temple is unique in many ways. The spire, topped by a statue of Angel Moroni, 
                    rises from a tiered tower faced with louvered vents that appear to be shuttered windows. The west 
                    end of the single story building is accentuated by a stained-glass bay window. The temple grounds 
                    are landscaped with lawns, flower gardens and more than 250 trees and 4,500 shrubs. Retaining walls 
                    and fence foundations are built of manufactured stones painted to match the prominent, 300-foot-high 
                    Rimrock cliffs that border the rear side of the temple property.
                    <br><br>
                    Inside, the temple is a model of space efficiency featuring all of the amenities of larger 
                    temples—including a laundry, brides' room, chapel, and clothing rental desk—in less total 
                    square footage than other recently built larger temples. The temple has two ordinance rooms 
                    for a two-stage ceremony. A clear skylight over the main foyer offers patrons a view of the Angel 
                    Moroni statue atop the spire.
